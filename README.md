Copycat of Google's Homepage 

This project is an attempt to recreate Google's Homepage and to deconstruct numerous elements of the html code.

Items to be done:

Insert the Google logo / image and centere it both vertically and horizontally. 

Add the search bar below this.

Add two square buttons with light grey backround below the search bar, titled "Google Search" & "I'm Felling Lucky".

Add "Gmail" "Images" and "Square Dot Log" links in top right corner (header bar?).

In the footer, add in "About", "Advertising", "Business", and "How Search Works" links in the left hand bottom corner. For the right hand corner, place "Privacy", "Terms", and "Settings". The footer needs to have a light grey backround.

We can inspect the dom elements to grab specific colours. Check the HTML documentation for button creation.
