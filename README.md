Copycat of Google's Homepage 

This project is an attempt to recreate Google's Homepage and to deconstruct numerous elements of the html code.

Items to be done:

Insert the Google logo / image and centre it both vertically and horizontally. 

Add the search bar below this.

Add two square buttons with light grey background below the search bar, titled "Google Search" & "I'm Felling Lucky".

Add "Gmail" "Images" and "Square Dot Log" links in top right corner (header bar?).

For this, I utilized the "CSS Navigation Bar". I matched the font and colour for the words "Gmail" and "Images".  

Regarding the square-dot image, I made a screen shot of the image and saved it as a "png".

In order to size it (somewhat) appropriately, I created a new div / container and set the "container img” width dimension to "100%" and the "height" dimension to “auto" which matched the images width to the container width. Therefore, sizing the container dimensions, now also resized the png image. 

In the footer, add in "About", "Advertising", "Business", and "How Search Works" links in the left hand bottom corner. For the right hand corner, place "Privacy", "Terms", and "Settings". The footer needs to have a light grey background.

We can inspect the “dom” elements to grab specific colours. Check the HTML documentation for button creation.
