Copycat of Google's Homepage 

This project is an attempt to recreate Google's Homepage and to deconstruct numerous elements of the html code.

The website will have three pages, one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search. 

For the Google Search page, the user can type in a query, click "Google Search", and be taken to the Google search results page.

For the Google Image Search page, the user can enter a query in the search bar and will be taken to Google Image search results.

For the Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)
- Find pages with… “all these words:”
- Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
- Find pages with… “any of these words:”
- Find pages with… “none of these words:”

Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.

- Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text. When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to search results page for their given query.

- Lucky. 

Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
- Aesthetics. 
The CSS you write should match Google’s own aesthetics as best as possible.



Items to be done:

Insert the Google logo / image and centre it both vertically and horizontally. 

Add the search bar below this.

Add two square buttons with light grey background below the search bar, titled "Google Search" & "I'm Feeling Lucky".

Add "Gmail" "Images" and "Square Dot Log" links in top right corner (navigation bar).

For this, I utilized the "CSS Navigation Bar". I matched the font and colour for the words "Gmail" and "Images".  

Regarding the square-dot image, I made a screen shot of the image and saved it as a "png".

In order to size it, I created a new container and set the "container img” width dimension to "100%" and the "height" dimension to “auto" which matched the images width to the container width. 

In the footer, add in "About", "Advertising", "Business", and "How Search Works" links in the left hand bottom corner. For the right hand corner, place "Privacy", "Terms", and "Settings". The footer needs to have a light grey background.

We can inspect the “dom” elements to grab specific colours. Check the HTML documentation for button creation.
